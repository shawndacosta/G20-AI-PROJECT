Predicting flight delays and cancellations using AI

This project aims to design an AI-powered system capable of predicting flight delays, estimating their duration, identifying their most likely causes, and detecting potential cancellations using operational flight data.

Based on a machine learning model trained on real airline performance statistics, the system integrates AI techniques within an interactive command-line interface. The user can select flight characteristics such as airline, departure airport, month, and other available parameters through a guided menu.

Once the inputs are provided, the program summarizes the selected flight profile and delivers several predictive results: whether the flight is likely to be delayed, whether it may be cancelled, the estimated delay duration, and the most probable cause of the delay or cancellation. For each of these outcomes, the system also provides a probability score indicating the modelâ€™s confidence in its prediction.

This interactive prototype demonstrates how artificial intelligence can enhance decision-making and reliability in the aviation industry by transforming complex data analysis into an accessible, user-friendly, and intelligent tool.

# 🏡 AI Powered House Price Prediction System
Predicting real estate prices using machine learning

This project aims to design an AI-powered system capable of estimating the market value of houses across the United States using historical real estate data. Based on a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of property listings, the system predicts selling prices from key characteristics such as location, house size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and land area.

The system uses AI techniques within an interactive interface where the user can select the state, city, ZIP code, and property features through a guided menu. Once the inputs are provided, the program summarizes the selected property profile and delivers a predicted price along with a local accuracy score computed from similar houses in the same area.

This prototype demonstrates how artificial intelligence can enhance decision-making in the real estate sector by transforming extensive housing data into a clear, accessible, and intelligent prediction tool.

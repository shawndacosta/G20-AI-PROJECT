# 🏡 AI Powered House Price Prediction System
Predicting real estate prices using machine learning

This project aims to design an AI-powered system capable of estimating the market value of houses across the United States using historical real estate data. Based on a machine learning model trained on a large dataset of property listings, the system predicts selling prices from key characteristics such as location, house size, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and land area.

The system uses AI techniques within an interactive interface where the user can select the state, city, ZIP code, and property features through a guided menu. Once the inputs are provided, the program summarizes the selected property profile and delivers a predicted price along with a local accuracy score computed from similar houses in the same area.

This prototype demonstrates how artificial intelligence can enhance decision-making in the real estate sector by transforming extensive housing data into a clear, accessible, and intelligent prediction tool.

# I. Introduction

## Motivation

Estimating the market value of a house is a central challenge in real estate. Prices fluctuate depending on location, property characteristics, and evolving market trends. For buyers, sellers, and professionals, having a quick and reliable estimation tool can significantly improve decision-making.

Our motivation was to design an accessible AI-powered system capable of predicting house prices across the United States using historical real estate data. By relying on machine learning, the system can capture hidden patterns in property listings and provide consistent estimations, even in regions where prices vary widely.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to develop:

- A *cleaned and structured dataset* from large-scale real estate data  
- A *machine learning model* capable of predicting house prices  
- An *interactive interface* where the user selects:
  - the state  
  - the city  
  - the ZIP code  
  - basic property features (bedrooms, bathrooms, house size, land size)

The system then returns:
- a *predicted price*, and  
- a *local accuracy score* based on similar houses in the same area.

This introduction summarises the motivation behind the project and the expected outcome: a clear, functional, and intelligent price prediction tool.
